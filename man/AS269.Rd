\title{Higher order Cornish Fisher approximation.}
\usage{
AS269(z,cumul,order.max=NULL,all.ords=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{the quantiles of the normal distribution. an atomic vector.}

\item{cumul}{the standardized cumulants of order 3, 4, ..., k. an atomic
vector.}

\item{order.max}{the maximum order approximation, must be greater than
\code{length(cumul)+2}.
We assume the cumulants have been adjusted to reflect that the random
variable has unit variance ('standardized cumulants')}

\item{all.ords}{a logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then results are returned
as a matrix, with a column for each order of the approximation. Otherwise
the results are a matrix with a single column of the highest order
approximation.}
}
\value{
A matrix, which is, depending on \code{all.ords}, either with one column per 
order of the approximation, or a single column giving the maximum order
approximation. There is one row per value in \code{z}.

Invalid arguments will result in return value \code{NaN} with a warning.

\details{
The Cornish Fisher approximation is the Legendre
inversion of the Edgeworth expansion of a distribution, but ordered
in a way that is convenient when used on the mean of a number of
independent draws of a random variable. 

Suppose \eqn{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} are \eqn{n} independent 
draws from some probability distribution. 
Letting 
\deqn{X = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{1 \le i \le n} x_i,}{X = (x_1 + x_2 + ... x_n) / sqrt(n),}
the Central Limit Theorem assures us that, assuming finite variance, 
\deqn{X \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{n}\mu, \sigma),}{X ~~ N(sqrt(n) mu, sigma),}
with convergence in \eqn{n}.

The Cornish Fisher approximation gives a more detailed picture of the
quantiles of \eqn{X}{X}, one that is arranged in decreasing powers of
\eqn{\sqrt{n}}{sqrt(n)}. The quantile function is the function \eqn{q(p)}{q(p)} 
such that \eqn{P\left(X \le q(p)\right) = q(p)}{P(x <= q(p)) = p}. The
Cornish Fisher expansion is 
\deqn{q(p) = \sqrt{n}\mu + \sigma \left(z + \sum_{3 \le j} c_j f_j(z)\right),}{q(p) = sqrt{n}mu + sigma (z + sum_{3 <= j} c_j f_j(z)),}
where \eqn{z = \Phi^{-1}(p)}{z = qnorm(p)}, and \eqn{c_j}{c_j} involves
standardized cumulants of the distribution of \eqn{x_i}{x_i} of order
up to \eqn{j}. Moreover, the \eqn{c_j}{c_j} include decreasing
powers of \eqn{\sqrt{n}}{sqrt(n)}, giving some justification for truncation.
When \eqn{n=1}{n=1}, however, the ordering is somewhat arbitrary.
}
\note{
A warning will be thrown if any of the z are greater than 
3.719017274 in absolute value; the traditional AS269 errors out in this
case.
