\section{Gram Charlier and Edgeworth Expansions}{


Given the raw moments of a probability distribution, we can approximate the probability 
density function, or the cumulative distribution function, via a Gram-Charlier 'A'
expansion on the standardized distribution.

Suppose \eqn{f(x)}{f(x)} is the probability density of some random
variable, and let \eqn{F(x)}{F(x)} be the cumulative distribution function.
Let \eqn{He_j(x)}{He_j(x)} be the \eqn{j}{j}th probabilist's Hermite
polynomial. These polynomials form an orthogonal basis, with respect to the
function \eqn{w(x)}{w(x)} of the Hilbert space of functions which are square
\eqn{w}{w}-weighted integrable. The weighting function is 
\eqn{w(x) = e^{-x^2/2} = \sqrt{2\pi}\phi(x)}{w(x) = e^{-x^2/2} = sqrt(2pi) phi(x)}.
The orthogonality relationship is
\deqn{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} He_i(x) He_j(x) w(x) \mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{2\pi} j! \delta_{ij}.}{integral_-inf^inf He_i(x) He_j(x) w(x) dx = sqrt(2pi)j!dirac_ij.}

Expanding the density \eqn{f(x)}{f(x)} in terms of these polynomials in the
usual way (abusing orthogonality) one has
\deqn{f(x) \approx \sum_{0\le j} \frac{He_j(x)}{j!} \phi(x) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) He_j(z) \mathrm{d}z.}{f(x) = sum_{0 <= j} (He_j(x)/j!) phi(x) integral_-inf^inf f(z) He_j(z) dz.}
The cumulative distribution function is 'simply' the integral of this
expansion. Abusing certain facts regarding the PDF and CDF of the normal
distribution and the probabilist's Hermite polynomials, the CDF has
the representation
\deqn{F(x) = \Phi(x) - \sum_{1\le j} \frac{He_{j-1}(x)}{j!} \phi(x) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) He_j(z) \mathrm{d}z.}{F(x) = Phi(x) - sum_{1 <= j} (He_{j-1}(x)/j!) phi(x) integral_-inf^inf f(z) He_j(z) dz.}

These series contain coefficients defined by the probability distribution 
under consideration. They take the form
\deqn{c_j = \frac{1}{j!}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) He_j(z) \mathrm{d}z.}{c_j = (1/j!) integral_-inf^inf f(z) He_j(z) dz.}
Using linearity of the integral, these coefficients are easily computed in
terms of the coefficients of the Hermite polynomials and the raw, uncentered
moments of the probability distribution under consideration. Note that it may be the
case that the computation of these coefficients suffers from bad numerical
cancellation for some distributions, and that an alternative formulation
may be more numerically robust.

\section{Generalized Gram Charlier Expansions}{


The Gram Charlier 'A' expansion is most appropriate for random variables
which are vaguely like the normal distribution. For those which are like
another distribution, the same general approach can be pursued. One needs
only define a weighting function, \eqn{w}, which is the density of the
'parent' probability distribution, then find polynomials,
\eqn{p_n(x)}{p_n(x)} which are orthogonal with respect to \eqn{w} over
its support. One has
\deqn{f(x) = \sum_{0\le j} p_j(x) w(x) \frac{1}{h_j} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) p_j(z) \mathrm{d}z.}{f(x) = sum_{0 <= j} p_j w(x) (1/h_j) integral_-inf^inf f(z) p_j(z) dz.}
Here \eqn{h_j}{h_j} is the normalizing constant:
\deqn{h_j = \int w(z)p_j^2(z)\mathrm{d}z.}{h_j = integral w(z)p_j^2(z) dz.}
One must then use facts about the orthogonal polynomials to approximate
the CDF.

Another approach to arrive at the same computation is described by 
Berberan-Santos.

\section{Cornish Fisher Approximation}{


The Cornish Fisher approximation is the Legendre
inversion of the Edgeworth expansion of a distribution, but ordered
in a way that is convenient when used on the mean of a number of
independent draws of a random variable. 

Suppose \eqn{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} are \eqn{n} independent 
draws from some probability distribution. 
Letting 
\deqn{X = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{1 \le i \le n} x_i,}{X = (x_1 + x_2 + ... x_n) / sqrt(n),}
the Central Limit Theorem assures us that, assuming finite variance, 
\deqn{X \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{n}\mu, \sigma),}{X ~~ N(sqrt(n) mu, sigma),}
with convergence in \eqn{n}.

The Cornish Fisher approximation gives a more detailed picture of the
quantiles of \eqn{X}{X}, one that is arranged in decreasing powers of
\eqn{\sqrt{n}}{sqrt(n)}. The quantile function is the function \eqn{q(p)}{q(p)} 
such that \eqn{P\left(X \le q(p)\right) = q(p)}{P(x <= q(p)) = p}. The
Cornish Fisher expansion is 
\deqn{q(p) = \sqrt{n}\mu + \sigma \left(z + \sum_{3 \le j} c_j f_j(z)\right),}{q(p) = sqrt{n}mu + sigma (z + sum_{3 <= j} c_j f_j(z)),}
where \eqn{z = \Phi^{-1}(p)}{z = qnorm(p)}, and \eqn{c_j}{c_j} involves
standardized cumulants of the distribution of \eqn{x_i}{x_i} of order
\eqn{j} and higher. Moreover, the \eqn{c_j}{c_j} feature decreasing powers
of \eqn{\sqrt{n}}{sqrt(n)}, giving some justification for truncation.
When \eqn{n=1}{n=1}, however, the ordering is somewhat arbitrary.
